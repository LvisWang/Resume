            <h2>Greetings!</h2>
            <p>In the past 5 years, I've been diving deep into the world of experimental physics. It's been a journey that not just sharpened my thinking and problem-solving skills but also taught me the art of patience when facing challenges.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm jumping into the lively realm of crypto, where things move fast, and each day is a new adventure.</p>
            <p>Passionate about both nature and science, I find joy in exploring the wonders of the universe :D</p>
